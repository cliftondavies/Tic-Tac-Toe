# Tic Tac Toe

## Aim

> To build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other, and the board is displayed in between turns.

## Game Rules

Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players. The objective of the game is to get three in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. You play on a 3x3 game board. A board with the nine positions numbers as follows:

The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing an X or an O on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the game is declared a draw.
